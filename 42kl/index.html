      <h1>Calling all new 42KL Pisciners!</h1>
    </div>

<div class="container">
    <h3>With the pandemic still going on and the 42KL campus hasn't opened it doors yet.</h3>

    <p>We here at Awespyre would like to alleviate and help new Pisciners with some of the struggles they might have at an affordable price. If you struggle with weak home internet or are unable to focus at home and live near us, we would like to welcome you to do your work at our venue.</p>

    <p>With the current SOP regulations, we can accommodate at most <strong>6 Pisciners</strong> at our venue. We provide free wifi with mesh network to ensure that your connection is stable. Free drinks and snacks are provided with additional heating apparatuses in case anyone wishes to reheat their delivery or takeaway food.</p>
